### Linear Search

- Check elements one by one
- Recommended for unsorted arrays only

### Binary Search

- Works only for sorted arrays
- The steps are as follows:
  - If the element is less than the middle element of the array, the right subarray is eliminated; otherwise, the left subarray is eliminated
  - This process is continued until the element is found or the whole array is visited
