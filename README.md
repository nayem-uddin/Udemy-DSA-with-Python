#### **Why learning DSA?**
- To organize the data (data structure) and use them efficiently (algorithm).
- To answer the interview questions as the interviewers ask such questions to assess the candidate's
  1. expertise in problem-solving,
  2. ability to learn fundamental programming concepts in a limited time.

# **Data Structures**
- Data structures are different ways of organizing data on the computer that can be used effectively.
- Types of data structures:
  1. Primitive: built-in data structures in a language (e.g., int, float, bool, string, character)
  2. Non-primitive: user-defined data structures <br>
     1. Linear: data are arranged in memory in a linear, sequential manner <br>
         - Static: structure-related memory location is fixed at compile time (e.g., array) <br>
         - Dynamic: associated memory location changes (e.g., linked list, stack, queue) <br>
     2. Non-linear: data items are not organized sequentially (e.g., graph, tree) <br>

# **Algorithms**
- An algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a task
- Criteria for a good algorithm:
  1. Correctness
  2. Efficiency
- Types of algorithms:
  - `Simple recursive` uses recursion (calling a function within the same function)
  - `Divide and conquer` divides the problems into smaller sub-problems and solve them
  - `Dynamic programming` uses memoization (using previous results to find the best result)
  - `Greedy` takes the best without worrying about the future, with the hope of finding the global optimum solution by choosing the local optimum solution at each step
  - `Brute force` tries all possibilities until the best solution is found
  - `Randomized` uses a random number at least once during the computation to make a decision
